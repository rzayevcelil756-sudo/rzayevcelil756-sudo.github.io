<h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>

<p class="muted">
  I’m Jalil Rzayev, a Computer Science major who enjoys combining logical thinking with creativity.
  I studied at the Physics, Mathematics, and Informatics Lyceum, where I built a strong foundation in analytical problem-solving.
  Over time, I earned both national and international awards in mathematics and computer science, which motivated me to aim higher and work more consistently.
  I enjoy learning how things work deeply—whether it’s a proof in math or a system in computing—and then explaining it clearly to others.
  Outside academics, music is a big part of my life: I play both piano and guitar, and it helps me stay focused and balanced.
  I’m currently building projects to improve my skills step-by-step and grow into a stronger developer.
  My main goal is to keep learning, building, and turning ideas into clean, useful results.
