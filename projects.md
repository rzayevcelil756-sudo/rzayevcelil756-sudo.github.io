    <h3>Project 1 — How does hardware work?</h3>
    <p>
      In this project, we explored how hardware logic works using basic logic gates.
      We practiced building and understanding circuits with AND, OR, XOR, and NAND gates, and learned how combining these gates creates more complex behavior.
      The goal was to connect theory with real implementation and strengthen our problem-solving mindset.

    <h3>Project 2 — Teaching and Sharing Knowledge at School</h3>
    <p>
      This project focused on sharing what we know with younger students in a school environment.
      We visited the school, explained concepts in a simple way, and helped students learn through examples and practice.
      It was a great experience in communication, teamwork, and making learning feel engaging and friendly.
